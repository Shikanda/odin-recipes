 <h2>Description.</h2>

<P>This is a Kenyan favourite unleaven flatbread introduced to Kenya from India, it goes with different types of stews, drinks and eaten at all times of the day.It is simple to prepare with a simple enough procedure to follow.</P>
<h3>Ingredients.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All purpose Wheat flour.</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Cooking oil.</li>
  <li>Water.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Mix the dry ingredients, namely all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add some oil, and the water a little at a time, then use 
       your fists or an electric mixer to knead everything to a dough.</li>
  <li> Add the oil and knead some more, for about two minutes. The dough should now feel soft and pliable, and should no longer stick to the fingers. </li>
  <li> Cover the dough with a clean and damp kitchen cloth or plastic wrap and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
  <li> Divide the dough into equally-sized balls. Lightly dust a wooden pastry board or your kitchen counter with flour, roll each ball of dough in flour and use a rolling pin to roll each to a circle of about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. Dust lightly with more flour, if the dough sticks to the rolling board (see the useful notes segment below, regarding how to make plain chapatis).</li>
  <li> Cover the coiled balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel and allow this to rest for 10 minutes. Next, lightly dust your kitchen counter or wooden pastry board with flour again and roll out each ball to a circular flatbread about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter and 3mm thick (about â…›th inch). Hint: feel free to make your chapati as small or as large as you prefer.</li>
  <li> Bring a non-stick or heavy-bottomed pan to high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to a medium and placed the rolled chapati dough on top. Cook each side until brown spots form.</li>
  <li> Lightly brush the cooked surface with melted ghee or cooking oil, allow the bottom to also brown and puff up, flip and fry the oiled side for one to two minutes or until cooked equally.</li>
